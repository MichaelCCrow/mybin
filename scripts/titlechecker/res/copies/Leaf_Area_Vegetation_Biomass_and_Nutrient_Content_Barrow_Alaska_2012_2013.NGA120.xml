      <abstract>This dataset reports measurements of plant leaf area, biomass, and nutrient carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) during 2012 and 2013 at the Next-Generation Ecosystem Experiments (NGEE) Arctic field site near Barrow, Alaska. In late July, 2012, vegetation was harvested from 0.25 x 0.25 m plots at the centers, edges and troughs of four polygons in each of four areas of contrasting moisture regime and polygon type (Areas A, B, C, and D of Intensive Site 1). Leaf area, biomass, and carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents were determined. In 2013, the plant community in a 10x10 cm subplots in Areas A and B was harvested at 2-week intervals from 22 June to 29 August. Plant biomass and foliar N content were determined as in 2012.&#xD;

        <methdesc>Live material was separated by species and plant part, area of leaves was measured on a LiCor Area Meter, and then material was dried at 70 oC for 2-3 days and weighed. All plant material was ground (2601 Pica Blender Mill, Cianflone Scientific Instruments, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), and N and C contents were determined using a Model 4010 Elemental Combustion System (Costech Analytical Technologies, Valencia, CA, USA). Phosphorus concentrations in the plant tissues were analyzed in Kjedahl digests on a QuikChem 8500 analyzer (Lachat Instruments, Loveland, CO, USA) using Lachat Quikchem Method 13-115-01-1-B.</methdesc>
