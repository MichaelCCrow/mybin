      <abstract>This dataset includes associated information about individual core samples (e.g. collection date, storage location, core length, thaw depth). This information is supplemental to the "NGEE Instrumentation and Sample Site Coordinates, Barrow, Alaska USA" dataset. Boxes with no data indicate the data are not available or unknown.</abstract>
      <purpose>Data were collected for analytical analyses in order to improve our understanding of subsurface processes.</purpose>

Drilled by: name of the lab/university that collected the core &#xD;
Storage location:  name of the lab/university where core is being stored&#xD;
Collection type: status of the core during collection. Frozen, thawed, or mixed. &#xD;
Core collection protocols: protocols that describe the steps or methods for the collection of the core&#xD;
Subsampled: indicates if the core has been processed or cut. Yes or no. &#xD;
GPS waypoint name: name that the core was given in hand-held GPS unit&#xD;
DGPS elevation: elevation as determined by dGPS&#xD;
Core hole depth: depth of hole drilled for core collection [cm]&#xD;
Core length: core length as measured in the field [cm]&#xD;
Core length lab: core length as measured in the lab [cm]&#xD;
