      <abstract>Data includes soil temperature and soil moisture measured at the Kougarok hill slope located at Kougarok Road, Mile Marker 64. Most measurements are from monitoring stations with permanently installed probes though the data also includes single point measurements from handheld devices. Data collection began in July 2016 and is ongoing. Dataset DOI:10.5440/1346195; http://dx.doi.org/10.5440/1346195.</abstract>
      <purpose>Soil temperature and moisture were measured at several different ecotypes along the hill slope to characterize the environment at locations where plant traits were sampled.</purpose>

    <logic>The first 24 hours of data from soil temperature and monitoring stations were discarded to ensure probes were fully equilibrated with the soil environment for all logged data.</logic>

        <methdesc>HOBO micro-stations (H21-002) were installed for continuous monitoring of soil temperature and moisture. The stations were placed within a 10" x 8" x 6" water-tight plastic enclosure, and the wires for the probes were run from the enclosure through a liquid-tight flexible steel conduit. We installed HOBO stations upslope of 10 vegetation plots (see 'Waypoints for intensive and reference plots' and 'Ecotypes and wx stations' tabs for more information on locations). Each HOBO station has one moisture probe (S-SMD-M005) and one temperature probe (S-TMB-M002). A soil face was made by cutting out an approximately 30 cm x 30 cm soil pit, and the probes were installed into the face on the opposite side from the HOBO station. The temperature probe was installed horizontally at 2 cm depth, and the moisture probe was installed horizontally (though the probe itself was oriented vertically), with the top of the probe at 8 cm depth. Prior to installation, each sensor was tested in distilled water for moisture and temperature readout (both were within the given specs for each of the 10 stations). The sensors were then launched with the clock set to Alaskan standard time, and asked to log every 30 minutes. The day after installation, data was downloaded from station H using the HOBO shuttle (U-DT-1), and the data looked good. The first 24 hours of recorded measurements from each plot (dates 7/5/2016 and 7/6/2016) were discarded to ensure the sensors had equilibrated to the soil environment.&#xD;

Single point measurements of soil moisture were also made periodically at vegetation plots and near HOBO monitoring stations using a handheld TDR probe.</methdesc>
