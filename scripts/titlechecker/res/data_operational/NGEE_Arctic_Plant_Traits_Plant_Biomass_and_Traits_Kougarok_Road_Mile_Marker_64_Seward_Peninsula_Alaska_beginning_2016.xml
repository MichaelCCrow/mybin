      <abstract>Data includes aboveground biomass and plant traits for destructive harvests performed at the Kougarok hill slope located at Kougarok Road, Mile Marker 64. Data collection began in July 2016. Aboveground biomass and aboveground plant traits are available for shrub and understory species found in vegetation plots. Paired observations of aboveground and belowground plant traits are available for select shrub species. Data upload will be complete March 2016.</abstract>
      <purpose>Biomass data was collected to provide site specific values as well as determine whether exisiting allometric relationships could be used to quantify shrub biomass on a landscape level. Plant trait data was collected to identify 1) tradeoffs between aboveground and belowground plant traits and 2) plant traits that are associated with important ecosystem processes.</purpose>

        <methdesc>Aboveground biomass was measured for tall shrub species by harvesting one shrub of each species present in the vegetation plot. Aboveground biomass of understory species was measured by clipping and sorting all aboveground biomass within a 20 cm x 50 cm area in the vegetation plot. Paired observations of above and belowground plant traits were collected by harvesting shrub individuals growing near vegetation plots. Roots were traced from the base of the shrub to root tips and had traits (branching, diameter, specific root area, chemistry) measured in the lab. Leaf and wood samples from all harvest plants had traits (specific leaf area, wood density, leaf and wood chemistry) measured in the lab.</methdesc>
