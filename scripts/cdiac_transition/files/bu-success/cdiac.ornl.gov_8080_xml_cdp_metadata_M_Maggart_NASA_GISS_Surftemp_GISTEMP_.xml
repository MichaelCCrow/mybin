 is the most comprehensive and direct source of information for these data. Users are strongly encouraged to visit the NASA GISS Web site, where you can specify input for making customized maps, graphs, and subsets of the data, in addition to learning many more interesting details about these data and their analysis.
Here, we seek to give users a brief, high-level overview of
the GISTEMP analysis and provide you with convenient access to the main time series graphs, data tables, and related references. This brief summary of the methods employed by the GISTEMP Team in their analysis is mostly borrowed from their NASA GISS Web pages.
Significant updates to the GISTEMP Team methods are described in a .
They describe the use of satellite-observed nightlights to identify measurement stations located in extreme
darkness and adjust temperature trends of urban and peri-urban stations for non-climatic factors, verifying
that urban effects on analyzed global change are small. The paper compares alternative analyses, and addresses questions about perception and reality of global warming.
The GISTEMP Team modifies the GHCN/USHCN/SCAR data in two steps to get to the station data on which all their tables, graphs, and maps are based: in step 1, if there are multiple records at a given station, these are combined into one record; in step 2 they adjust the non-rural stations in such a way that their long-term trend of annual means matches that of the mean of the neighboring rural stations. Records from urban stations without nearby rural staitons are dropped.

 time series show quite a bit of variability from the beginning of the record through about 1920, but no real trend. A significant warming of about 0.3&#176;C is observed in both series from about 1920 through the early- to mid-1940s, followed by a less dramatic cooling in both series through about the mid-1960s. From the 1970s through recent years, rapid warming is observed in both series; on the order of 0.6&#176;C. Overall, the earth's average surface temperature has now increased about 1.0&#176;C since the late-19th century.
