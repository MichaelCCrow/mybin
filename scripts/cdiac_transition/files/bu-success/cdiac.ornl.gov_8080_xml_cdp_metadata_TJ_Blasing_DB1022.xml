      <Text><![CDATA[ &#187;&#160;Air Samples, Niwot Ridge, Colorado
Stanley C. Tyler
Department of Earth System Science
University of California
Air samples from Niwot Ridge, Colorado (41&#176;N, 105&#176;W) and
Monta&#241;a de Oro, CA (35&#176;N, 121&#176;W) have been collected at
approximately semi-monthly to monthly intervals since the mid 1990s. The
beginning dates for each gas and isotope analyzed are as follows:
Such time series can provide information about: (1) seasonal
cycling of CO, CO, and
CH sources and sinks in background air,
(2) trends in atmospheric concentrations of CO
and CH and their stable carbon, oxygen,
and hydrogen isotopes, (3) the distribution of the hydroxyl (OH) radical
in the atmosphere, and (4) the role of the terrestrial biosphere as a source
or sink of atmospheric CO. The data
presented here are discussed in detail by Tyler et al., (1999).
Samples at Niwot Ridge were collected before noon in order to increase the
likelihood of sampling when the prevailing wind was from the west, so as to
represent well-mixed background air from over the western United States without *
interference from regional contamination. Samples from Monta&#241;a de Oro were
collected in late afternoon or early evening during periods when prevailing
winds were from the west or northwest (i.e., from the Pacific Ocean).
Air from Niwot Ridge was collected into passivated aluminum high-pressure cylinders
using a RIX model SA-3 compressor; air from Monta&#241;a de Oro was collected into
electro-polished 32-liter stainless steel canisters using a portable battery-
operated piston pump (Model 415CDC30/12B, Thomas Co., Sheboygan WI). Mixing
ratios from canister and cylinder samples were measured at The University
of California-Irvine, using a Hewlett Packard 5880A gas chromatograph with a flame
ionization detector, for CO and
CH, and a Shimadzu Model 14A Gas Chromatograph
with a Model RGD2 reduction gas analyzer detector (Trace Analytical, Menlo Park,
California), for CO. Mixing-ratio working standards for CH
and CO are based on the National Atmospheric and Oceanic
Administration/Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (NOAA/CMDL) reference
scale, and have been inter-compared with and calibrated to NOAA/CMDL reference
standards (Lang et al., 1990, for CH;
Novelli et al., 1991, for CO; Thoning et al., 1987, for
CO). The precision level for measurements of
CO is ~&#177;3-4 ppm (1% uncertainty
around 342 ppm); the precision level for measurements of
CH is ~&#177;5 to 10 ppb for values around a
working-reference-gas value of 1903 ppb, and for measurements of CO, the precision level is
~&#177;1.3 ppb for measurements around 133.5 ppb. Oxygen and carbon isotopes were
measured on a Finnigan MAT Model 252 Isotope-Ratio Mass Spectrometer (IRMS).
Precision of measurement on clean
dry CO gas standards is &#177;0.01%. The
reproducibility of &#948;C
measurements from ~200 liters each of replicate air samples, when all possible errors
associated with differences in sample canisters, sample pumping, vacuum line processing,
and isotope measurement are taken into account, is &#177;0.05% for
&#948;C of
CH, 0.20% for
&#948;C of CO and &#177;0.01% for
&#948;
 analyses
were performed using a cf-Gas-Chromatography/IRMS coupled to a custom-designed
CH gas preconcentrator (Rice et al., 2001). A pyrolysis
oven converts CH
after its separation from the air stream and before its detection by the mass
spectrometer. Precision of measurement is &#177;1.3% for CH
processed from ~63 ml of whole air.
Additional information on instrumentation, calibration, analysis procedures,
and reporting standards is given in the "readme.txt" file and references listed
therein. In particular, Tyler et al. (1999) describe much of the experimental
detail and sample collection.

      <Notes><![CDATA[CO and associated 13C: <br>
 At the same sites (Niwot Ridge, Colorado and Montan'a de Oro, California) where we collect air samples to analyze for CH4 data, we also measure CO mixing ratios and 13CO isotope ratios (e.g., Tyler et al., 1999; DB1022, CDIAC archives). Atmospheric CO mixing ratio measurements begin with the first dates of sample collection at Niwot Ridge and Montan'a de Oro while measurements of d13C -CO begin in late 1999 (NWT) and early 2000 (MDO). Hydroxyl radicals (OH), the most important oxidizing agent in the atmosphere, react with CO rather quickly, giving a CO lifetime of the order of a few months, to produce CO2 [Levy, 1971; Logan et al., 1981; Levine et al., 1985]. Thus, knowledge of the sources and sinks of tropospheric CO is vital to understanding and quantifying the distribution of OH concentrations in the atmosphere. Admittedly, 14C and d18O-CO, which we do not currently measure, provide at least as much information as the d13C -CO data. However, the simultaneous measurements of CH4 and CO for mixing and 13C isotope ratio (as well as CO2 data which we also collect) help us to screen samples for outliers not representative of well-mixed background surface air.
<br><br>
Site descriptions, sample collection procedures, and most mixing ratio and isotope ratio analytical techniques are described in our sample archives for atmospheric CH4, appearing as the abstch4.txt file in the CDIAC DB1022 data base. Small differences or additions relevant to the CO data are noted below.
<br><br>
CO2 and associated 13C and 18O: <br>
At the same sites above where we collect air samples to analyze for CH4 and CO data, 
we also measure CO2 mixing and d13C and d18O isotope ratios (e.g., Tyler et al., 1999; DB1022, CDIAC archives).  Atmospheric CO2 measurements of mixing and stable isotope ratio begin with January 1999 at both Niwot Ridge (NWT) and Montana de Oro while (MDO). Measurements of d13C in atmospheric CO2 have long been used to help interpret the global CO2 budget [e.g., Keeling, 1958 and 1961; Mook et al., 1983; Keeling et al., 1984; Quay et al., 1992; Tans et al., 1993], while d18O measurements in atmospheric CO2 have added an important component to the interpretation of CO2 fluxes more recently [e.g., Ciais et al., 1997; Flanagan et al., 1997; Miller et al., 1999].
<br><br>
The d13C of atmospheric CO2 is an indicator of either plant photosynthesis or air-sea 
exchange of CO2.  This is because terrestrial plants preferentially fix 12C in photosynthesis, thereby leaving remaining CO2 relatively 13C heavy, while the dissolution and evaporation of CO2 to and from ocean waters is practically non-fractionating isotopically.  In addition, the burning of fossil fuel has significantly increased the CO2 content of the atmosphere, with a corresponding decrease in the d13C signal toward more negative values.  On the other hand, the d18O of atmospheric CO2 is a marker to constrain separately the gross uptake 
(photosynthesis) and release (respiration) of carbon by terrestrial biota.  This is 
because CO2 can exchange an 18O atom with two isotopically distinct reservoirs, i.e., 
either evaporating leaf water during photosynthesis or soil moisture during respiration.  However, the simultaneous measurements of CH4 and CO for mixing and 13C isotope ratio (as well as CO2 data which we also collect) help us to screen samples for outliers not representative of well-mixed background surface air.
<br><br>
Site descriptions, sample collection procedures, and most mixing ratio and isotope 
ratio analytical techniques have been described in our sample archives for atmospheric CH4 appearing in the CDIAC database.  Small differences or additions to these are noted below.
<br><br>
CH4 and associated 2H and 13C: <br>
We report mixing ratios and dD and d13C measurements of atmospheric CH4 from air samples collected  bi-weekly from fixed surface sites in the United States. Our fixed surface sites are located at the mid-continental site Niwot Ridge, CO (41 degrees N, 105 degrees W) and a Pacific coastal site receiving strong westerlies, Montan'a de Oro, CA (35 degrees N, 121 degrees W). Data from multiyear approximately bi-weekly sampling provide information relating seasonal cycling of CH4 sources and sinks in background air, record long term trends in CH4 mixing and isotope ratio related to the atmospheric CH4 loading, and may indicate regional CH4 sources. Our continuous record of CH4 mixing ratio and d13C-CH4 from Niwot Ridge extends from 1995 to 2001 while that of Montan'a de Oro extends from 1996 to 2001. A more recently initiated time series of measurements of dD-CH4 were begun during 1998 at Niwot Ridge and during 2000 at Montan'a de Oro. We are archiving these data to make them available 
for modeling and advanced calculations by other atmospheric researchers. The air sample collections continue to the present time. We will archive these data as soon as is practicable in order to increase the value of the time series of measurements.]]></Notes>
