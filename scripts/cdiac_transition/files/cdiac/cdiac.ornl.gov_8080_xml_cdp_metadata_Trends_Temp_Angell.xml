National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Air Resources Laboratory (R/E/AR),
SSMC3, Station 3459,
1315 East West Highway,
About Jim Angell: From the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (2005) - 
Nine tropical radiosonde stations in this 63-station network were identified as anomalous
in 
Angell (2003), also presented on the CDIAC website,
results in significant differences in many of the times series and their associated
temperature trends. Full details are given in 
Angell (2003), which will allow
users to better judge the utility of the historical 63-station-network time series.
Surface temperatures and thickness-derived temperatures from a 63-station, globally distributed
radiosonde network have been used to estimate global, hemispheric, and zonal annual and
seasonal temperature deviations. Most of the temperature values used were column-mean
temperatures, obtained from the differences in height (thickness) between constant-pressure
surfaces at individual radiosonde stations. The pressure-height data before 1980 were obtained
from published values in . Between 1980 and 1990, Angell
used data from both the and the Global Telecommunications
System (GTS) Network received at the National Meteorological Center. Between 1990 and 1995,
the data were obtained only from GTS, and since 1995 the data have been obtained from
National Center for Atmospheric Research files. The data are evaluated as deviations from
the mean based on the interval 1958-1977. The station deviations have been averaged (with
equal weighting) to obtain annual and seasonal temperature deviations for the globe, the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and the following latitudinal zones: North (60&#176; N-90&#176; N)
and South (60&#176; S-90&#176; S) Polar; North (30&#176; N-60&#176; N) and
South (30&#176; S-60&#176; S) Temperate; North (10&#176; N-30&#176; N) and South
(10&#176; S-30&#176; S) Subtropical; Tropical(30&#176; S-30&#176; N);
and Equatorial (10&#176; S-10&#176; N). The seasonal calculations are for the standard
meteorological seasons (i.e., winter is defined as December, January, and February; spring
is March, April, and May, etc.) and the annual calculations are for December through the
following November (i.e., for the four meteorological seasons).
For greater details, see Angell and Korshover (1983) and Angell (1988, 1991).
Based on data from Angell's global network of 63 radiosonde stations, over the
period from 1958 through 2010, the global mean, near-surface air temperature
warmed by approximately 0.18&#176;C/decade, the 850-300 mb tropospheric layer warmed
by about 0.09&#176;C/decade, the 300-100 mb tropopause layer temperature cooled by
approximately -0.22&#176;C/decade (driven mainly by large changes in the Polar zones),
and the 100-50 mb low-stratospheric layer cooled by about -0.60&#176;C/decade.
At the surface, 2009 was the warmest year in the 53-year record (0.98&#176;C above
the long-term mean), and 2007 was the second warmest year with a departure of 0.97&#176;C.

      <Notes><![CDATA[ Based on data from Angell's global network of 63 radiosonde stations, over the period from 1958 through 2004, the global mean, near-surface air temperature warmed by approximately 0.16 degrees C/decade, the 850-300 mb tropospheric layer warmed by about 0.08 degrees C/decade, the 300-100 mb tropopause layer temperature cooled by approximately -0.24 degrees C/decade (driven mainly by large changes in the Polar zones), and the 100-50 mb low-stratospheric layer cooled by about -0.62 degrees C/decade. At the surface, 2002 remained the warmest year in the 47-year record (0.88 degrees C above the long-term mean), easily exceeding the previous record of 0.71 degrees C/decade set in 1998, which was matched by the 2004 anomaly, thus tying 1998 and 2004 as the second warmest years in the record.
<br><br>
 It is interesting to compare temperature trends from the relatively sparse 63-station radiosonde network to those from some of the other well-known global temperature records, e.g., the Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) data obtained from NOAA satellites (Christy et al. 2000). While comparisons between the exact same atmospheric layers cannot be made, the computed linear trend for the MSU from its beginning year (1979) through 2004 for the lower tropospheric layer from the surface up to 8 km (about 350 mb) shows an increase of about 0.08 degrees C/decade; whereas the Angell record for the 850-300 mb tropospheric layer over the same period shows no trend. The University of East Anglia data of Jones et al. (2001), derived from thousands of stations over the globe, indicate a global surface warming of 0.12 degrees C/decade over Angell's full period of record (1958-2004) compared to 0.16 degrees C/decade for the Angell data. For the years overlapping with the satellite period of record (1979-2004), the surface data of Jones et al. show an increasing trend of 0.17 degrees C/decade; quite close to the 0.20 degrees C/decade trend obtained from the 63-station network of Angell. ]]></Notes>
