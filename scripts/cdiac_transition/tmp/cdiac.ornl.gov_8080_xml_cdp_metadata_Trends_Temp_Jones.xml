These global and hemispheric temperature anomaly
time series, which incorporate land and marine data,
are continually updated and expanded by P. Jones of the 
with help from colleagues at the CRU and other institutions.
Some of the earliest work in producing these temperature series dates back to
Jones (1986a,b,c), Jones (1988, 1994), and
Jones and Briffa (1992). Most of the discussion of methods given here has been gleaned from the Frequently Asked
Questions
CRU temperature data web pages. Users are encouraged to visit the CRU Web site for the
most comprehensive overview of these data (the "HadCRUT4" dataset), other associated datasets, and the most recent
literature references to the work of Jones 
 time series are computed
consists of surface air temperature (SAT)
data (land-surface meteorological data and fixed-position weather ship data) from
over 3000 station records that
have been corrected for non-climatic errors, such as station
shifts and/or instrument changes (Jones 1994).
Coverage is denser over the more populated parts of the world, particularly
the United States, southern Canada, Europe and Japan. Coverage is sparsest over
the interior of the South American and African continents and over the Antarctic.
The number of available stations was small during the 1850s, but increases to
over 3000 stations during the 1951-90 period.
The marine data used are compiled at the
of the and consist of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) that incorporate in situ measurements from ships and
buoys. The SST data have been corrected for different types of buckets used before 1942
(Folland and Parker 1995; Parker 1994, 1995).
Since the majority of the marine observations come from the voluntary
observing fleet, coverage is reduced away from the main shipping lanes
and is minimal over the Southern Oceans. Maps/tables giving the density
of coverage through time are given for land regions by Jones and Moberg (2003)
and for the oceans by Rayner (2003). Both these sources, in addition
to more recent work (Rayner , 2006), also
extensively discuss the issue of consistency and homogeneity of the
measurements through time and the steps that have been taken to ensure all
non-climatic inhomogeneities have been removed.
The land and marine data components are combined by first
interpolating each to the same 5&amp;#176 x 5&amp;#176 latitude/longitude grid boxes.
The combined version takes values from each component and
weights the grid boxes where both occur (coastlines and islands). The
weighting method is described in detail in Jones (2001).
Land temperature anomalies are infilled where more than four of the surrounding
eight 5&#176; x 5&#176; grid boxes are present, as discussed in Jones (2001).
Infilling doesn't take place when the box is ocean, except when it
is covered by sea ice based on 1961-90 average conditions.
Assessing the accuracy of the resulting global and hemispheric
temperature anomalies has always been of critical importance in the
work of Jones .
Annual values are approximately accurate to +/- 0.05&#176;C (two standard errors)
for the period since 1951. They are about four times as uncertain during
the 1850s, with the accuracy improving gradually between 1860 and 1950,
except for temporary deteriorations during data-sparse, wartime intervals.
Estimating accuracy is far from a trivial task, as the individual grid boxes
are not independent of each other and the accuracy of each grid box time
series varies through time (although an employed variance adjustment has reduced
this influence to a large extent). The issue is discussed extensively by Brohan (2006),
Folland (2001a,b) extend discussion to the estimate of accuracy of trends in the
global and hemispheric series, including the additional uncertainties related
to homogeneity corrections.
 are now given to a precision of three
decimal places to enable seasonal values to be calculated to &#194;&#177;0.01&#176;C.
The extra precision implies no greater accuracy than two decimal places.
annual mean temperature anomalies
for the globe show relatively stable temperatures
from the beginning of the record
through about 1910, with relatively rapid and steady warming through the early 1940s, followed
by another period of relatively stable temperatures through the mid-1970s. From this point
onward, another rapid rise similar to that in the earlier part of the century is observed.
The year 2015 was by far the warmest year in the global record (0.75&#176;C above the 1961-1990 reference period mean).
This record uses the latest analysis, referred to as HadCRUT4 (Morice et al., 2012).
[Jones (1999) report the 1961-1990 reference period means for the globe, northern
hemisphere, and southern hemisphere as 14.0&#176;C, 14.6&#176;C, and 13.4&#176;C, respectively.]
 temperature record
(along with several other informative climate-related "Information Sheets" available from the CRU) may be found at , and states: 
"The period 2001-2010 (0.490&#194;&#176;C above the 1961-90 average) was 0.216&#194;&#176;C warmer than the 1991-2000 decade (0.274&#194;&#176;C above the 1961-90 average). 2015 is clearly the warmest year (0.745&#194;&#176;C) with 2014 (0.567&#194;&#176;C) second, slightly warmer than 2010 (0.559&#194;&#176;C), 2005 (0.544&#194;&#176;C) and 1998 (0.536&#194;&#176;C). The coldest year of the 21st century (2008 with a value of 0.395&#194;&#176;C) was warmer than all years in the 20th century with the exception of 1998. The average of the first five years of the present decade (2011-2015) is 0.051&#194;&#176;C warmer than the average for 2001-2010."
northern and southern hemisphere annual
trend series show some general similarities, e.g.,
little sign of trends before about 1900, a peak in the early 1940s, and the highest temperatures
occurring after 1980; but there are several notable differences. A steady period of warming is
seen for the northern hemisphere from about 1910 through the mid-1940s. For the southern
hemisphere, there is less warming observed from about 1910 through 1930, with sudden and
rapid warming from about 1930 through the mid-1940s. The northern hemisphere record shows
gradual cooling from the mid-1940s through the mid-1970s, followed by rapid temperature 
increases thereafter. The southern hemisphere shows an abrupt shift to cooler temperatures
after 1945, quite variable temperatures until the mid-1970s, followed by a gradual increase
over the remainder of the record.
, it is interesting
to note that for all seasons, a warming trend
does not commence until about 1910. All seasons show somewhat of a peak
in the 1940s and steady warming after about
the mid-1960s. The record warmth of 1998 still stands out as the
warmest year across all seasons except for austral spring (SON), which set a new record in 2015.
seasonal series for the northern hemisphere show warming from about 1910 through the early 1940s, but with the exception of spring (MAM) show cooling through the mid-1970s.
All seasons show a general warming from the mid-1970s onward, but recent
winters have on average been colder than those of the first decade of the 21st century. 2015 recorded the warmest spring, summer, and fall on record for the northern hemisphere.

through about 1910, with relatively rapid and steady warming through the early 1940s, followed
by another period of relatively stable temperatures through the mid-1970s. From this point
onward, another rapid rise similar to that in the earlier part of the century is observed.

"The period 2001-2010 (0.490&#194;&#176;C above the 1961-90 average) was 0.216&#194;&#176;C warmer than the 1991-2000 decade (0.274&#194;&#176;C above the 1961-90 average). 2015 is clearly the warmest year (0.745&#194;&#176;C) with 2014 (0.567&#194;&#176;C) second, slightly warmer than 2010 (0.559&#194;&#176;C), 2005 (0.544&#194;&#176;C) and 1998 (0.536&#194;&#176;C). The coldest year of the 21st century (2008 with a value of 0.395&#194;&#176;C) was warmer than all years in the 20th century with the exception of 1998. The average of the first five years of the present decade (2011-2015) is 0.051&#194;&#176;C warmer than the average for 2001-2010."
northern and southern hemisphere annual
trend series show some general similarities, e.g.,
little sign of trends before about 1900, a peak in the early 1940s, and the highest temperatures
occurring after 1980; but there are several notable differences. A steady period of warming is
seen for the northern hemisphere from about 1910 through the mid-1940s. For the southern
hemisphere, there is less warming observed from about 1910 through 1930, with sudden and
rapid warming from about 1930 through the mid-1940s. The northern hemisphere record shows
gradual cooling from the mid-1940s through the mid-1970s, followed by rapid temperature 
increases thereafter. The southern hemisphere shows an abrupt shift to cooler temperatures
after 1945, quite variable temperatures until the mid-1970s, followed by a gradual increase
over the remainder of the record.
, it is interesting
to note that for all seasons, a warming trend
does not commence until about 1910. All seasons show somewhat of a peak
in the 1940s and steady warming after about
the mid-1960s. The record warmth of 1998 still stands out as the
warmest year across all seasons except for austral spring (SON), which set a new record in 2015.
seasonal series for the northern hemisphere show warming from about 1910 through the early 1940s, but with the exception of spring (MAM) show cooling through the mid-1970s.
All seasons show a general warming from the mid-1970s onward, but recent
winters have on average been colder than those of the first decade of the 21st century. 2015 recorded the warmest spring, summer, and fall on record for the northern hemisphere.

      <Notes><![CDATA[ Trends in annual mean temperature anomalies for the globe show relatively stable temperatures from the beginning of the record through about 1910, with relatively rapid and steady warming through the early 1940s, followed by another period of relatively stable temperatures through the mid-1970s. From this point onward, another rapid rise similar to that in the earlier part of the century is observed. Nineteen ninety-eight was the warmest year of the global mean temperature series to date, followed by 1997. 1998's anomaly was 0.57 degrees C above the 1961-1990 reference period mean temperature. (Jones et al. (1999) report the 1961-1990 reference period means for the globe, northern hemisphere, and southern hemisphere as 14.0 degrees C, 14.6 degrees C, and 13.4 degrees C, respectively.) The most recent year of the record, 2000, also saw a significant positive temperature anomaly (0.29 degrees C), but represents a cooling compared to the recent very warm years of 1997 and 1998. Still, 2000 ties 1991 for the sixth warmest year in the global record, and the eight warmest years of the global record have all occurred since 1990. These are, in descending order, 1998, 1997, 1995, 1990, 1999, (2000 and 1991 - tie), and 1994. The findings of Jones and Briffa (1992) still offer a good general description of the full period of record at this point: the average surface air temperature of the globe has warmed ~0.5 degrees C since the middle of the nineteenth century. In addition, Briffa and Jones (1993) and Nicholls et al. (1996) (which made use of all but the last few years of the record described herein) concluded that the warming has varied in extent and magnitude across the globe and a few areas have even cooled since the nineteenth century. More recent analyses of the temperature data include Jones et al. (1999; 2001).

 The northern and southern hemisphere annual trends series show some general similarities, e.g., little sign of trends before about 1900, a peak in the early 1940s, and the highest temperatures occurring after 1980; but there are several notable differences. A steady period of warming is seen for the northern hemisphere from about 1910 through the early 1940s. For the southern hemisphere, there is no warming observed from about 1910 through 1930, but there was sudden and rapid warming from about 1930 through the early 1940s. The northern hemisphere record shows gradual cooling from the early 1940s through the mid-1970s, followed by rather steady temperature increases thereafter. The southern hemisphere shows an abrupt shift to cooler temperatures after 1945, followed by a gradual increase over several decades, and a general leveling off since the late 1980s. However, the southern hemisphere time series shows the two highest temperature anomalies occurring in 1997 and 1998. The 1990s in the northern hemisphere show a very different picture, with highly variable temperatures. After a very warm 1990, several much cooler years followed, with a return to then-record warmth in 1995, and the current record high in 1998. The cooler years of the early 1990s (mainly 1992 and 1993) are believed to have resulted from the effects of the dust veil produced by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo (Kelly et al. 1996; Parker et al. 1996). ]]></Notes>
