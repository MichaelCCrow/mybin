Donald Blake
Department of Chemistry,
University of California Irvine,
Whole-air samples are collected in conditioned, evacuated, 2-L stainless steel canisters; each canister
is filled to ambient pressure over a period of about 1 minute (approximately 20 seconds to 2 minutes).
These canisters are returned to the University of California at Irvine for chromatographic analysis.
Analysis for methane includes gas chromatography with flame ionization, as discussed
in 
Methane concentrations are reported for dry air, and are made relative to a primary standard purchased
from the Matheson Gas Company in 1977 and to a National Bureau of Standards standard purchased in
August 1982. Analytical precision is better than 2 parts per billion by volume. For additional
details for methane measurements, and some discussion about methane trends, see
.
Samples were cooled to allow
the more volatile components (e.g., argon, nitrogen, and oxygen) to be pumped away; the less volatile
components were then revolatilized by immersing the sample loop in hot (80&#176;C) water and
subsequently flushed into a helium carrier flow. After chromatographic analysis, air from each
sample was subjected to electron-capture analysis to distinguish between organic nitrates and
halocarbons, flame ionization which is sensitive to hydrocarbons, and mass spectroscopy for unambiguous
compound identification and selected ion monitoring. Signal from electron-capture and flame-ionization
detectors was routed to an integrator which produced hard copies of the analog responses, and
signals from all systems were routed to computers for further analysis. Each resulting chromatogram
was manually modified, and each peak was individually checked, to assure that the large range of
compound abundances and potential coelutors did not adversely affect quantification.
Multiple standards were employed; working standards were run every 2 hours and calibrated standards
were run twice daily. Standard gases used are discussed in 
For the compounds included
in this data set, precision can be taken as within 3%, and, in most cases, to within 2%. For specific
details on measurements of each gas, see 
Concentrations of each substance for all locations are plotted vs time to show
general temporal trends. The latitudinal distributions of concentrations, for all
dates, are also plotted. The sampling locations are varied so a general picture
of the global changes is given. The site
gives data about many of the same substances at a few latitudinally distributed
sites where concentrations are measured much more frequently so as to provide
continuous time series.
Methane concentrations had been rising prior to the mid 1990's when they began
to level off. A tendency for reduced concentrations during the summer months
in both hemispheres is related to increased production of hydroxyl (OH) radicals
under conditions of extended sunlight and increased humidity, and associated
destruction of methane and several nonmethane hydrocarbons that are subject to
hydroxyl attack. The graphs of concentrations vs. latitude show that methane,
as well as several nonmethane hydrocarbons, have their highest concentrations
at mid-to-high latitudes in the Northern-Hemisphere. This largely reflects
their source regions. However some substances (e.g., CFC-12) were largely
produced in the Northern Hemisphere but have a rather flat distribution over
all latitudes. This reflects discontinued emissions, so that the source regions
are no longer clearly evident while the remaining amounts have been evenly
mixed throughout the atmosphere.
Concentrations of CFCs 11 and 113 have declined in recent years, in response
to the Montreal Protocol of the late 1980's. CFC-12 has also begun to decline,
but the decline was delayed due to: (1) a longer atmospheric
lifetime than CFC-11 or CFC-113, (2) its use in long-lasting appliances such as
home refrigerators, and, possibly (3) particularly extensive stockpiling at the global scale,
due to a perceived lack of suitable replacement at the time production decreases
were being mandated. It is also difficult to find suitable replacements for some
other substances. For example, Halon 1211 is a particularly effective fire
extinguishing agent that has remained in use in many countries. Therefore, Halon 1211
concentrations have not declined. A large increase in spatial variance around 2001
may be at least partly due to a leak in one of the system lines. Checking with
principal investigators to identify such problems is always advised before drawing
conclusions from these data.
Since about 1990, trends in methyl chloroform and carbon tetrachloride have
been sharply downward, reflecting the phasing out of these substances due to
their toxic effects. Methyl chloroform has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime
than carbon tetrachloride, so methyl chloroform has declined to less than 10% of
its pre-1990 levels and is currently in the range of 10 parts per trillion, by
volume (pptv). Tetrachloroethene is a relatively short-lived compound
that has been used as a dry cleaner and degreaser. It has also shown a recent
decline in concentration. These chloroform data only go back to 1996, and AGAGE chloroform
data only to 1994, so effects of any earlier declines that may have occurred are not evident.
The alkyl nitrates (methyl, ethyl, and propyl nitrates) have a variety of
natural and anthropogenic sources. Concentrations of these compounds were
decreasing slightly until late 2003, when increases occurred, followed by more
recent large-percentage fluctuations. The cause of these fluctuations has not been determined, but
the graph of latitudinal distribution and the locations of the anomalously
high concentrations suggest natural sources.
The alkanes (ethane, butane, and propane) and ethyne (acetylene) are used
as fuel in torches, lighters and gas stoves. In general, concentrations of
these substances have not changed appreciably since 1996. The atmospheric
lifetimes of these substances vary throughout the year, being shortest in
summer when oxidative reactions with hydroxyl radicals (OH) are particularly
frequent due to the abundance OH at that time of year. In the table below,
these lifetimes are simply given as "less than one year" due to the low
likelihood of survival through a summer, regardless of time of emission.
