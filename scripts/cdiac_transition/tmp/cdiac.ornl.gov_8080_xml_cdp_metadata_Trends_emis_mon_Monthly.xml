T.J. Blasing and Gregg Marland
Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center,
Environmental Sciences Division,
Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
Christine Broniak
Department of Agricultural &amp; Resource Economics,
Oregon State University,
The data from which these carbon-emissions estimates were derived are values of fuel
consumed: in billions of cubic feet, for natural gas; in millions of barrels, for
petroleum products; and in thousands of short tons, for coal. The resulting emissions
estimates are expressed as teragrams of . A teragram is
10
metric tons. To convert from , multiply by 44/12 (=3.67).
Data are available for over 30 different petroleum products, with the exact breakdown
varying somewhat from year to year. These products have been treated separately here
until the final step of the estimation, at which time CO
emissions were summed and attributed to liquid petroleum products. These fuel-consumption
data are available from the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of
Energy. They are published in the Monthly Energy Review, and are available electronically from
The fuel-consumption values were multiplied by their respective thermal conversion
factors, which are in units of heat energy per unit of fuel (i.e., per cubic foot,
barrel, or ton). In keeping with conventional usage in the United States, values
are for the gross (higher) heating values of the respective fuels. Thermal conversion
factors are given in Appendix A of each issue of Monthly Energy Review, published
monthly by the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy.
The results are expressed in units of heat energy derived from the fuel. These
energy values were then multiplied by their respective carbon dioxide emission
factors, in units of the mass of carbon emitted per unit of energy liberated by
the oxidation of the carbon in the fuel. Carbon dioxide emission factors are given
in Tables A-15-17 of EPA (2003). Product-specific emissions factors were used for the the
myriad of petroleum products. Finally, the results were multiplied by 0.99 to allow
for the approximately 1 per cent of carbon that is not oxidized during combustion but
is released as soot, ash, or long-lived hydrocarbons. This is the same factor used
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (2002, Table A-14). except
for natural gas, for which EPA (2002) used a factor of 0.995, or 0.5 percent higher
than ours.
Several petroleum products have applications not related to energy production and are
not oxidized immediately when the products are consumed; these include asphalt, waxes,
petroleum coke, special naphtha, etc. In some cases (e.g., waxes) virtually no carbon
is oxidized during use; in other cases (e.g., petroleum coke) a substantial fraction
(e.g., estimated 50%) of the carbon is oxidized during use; for some products
(e.g. special naphtha), virtually all the carbon is oxidized within the time frame
of interest. The fraction of the carbon not oxidized in each of the various
petroleum products is given in Table A-14 of EPA 2003.
,
results are presented here in terms of the mass of C only. (To convert to mass of
CO, multiply the mass of C by 44/12). We assume that
any C emitted to the atmosphere as CO will be soon oxidized to
CO
C values
for each month were estimated as follows:
where C, P, and G are monthly values of carbon emissions from coal, petroleum
products, and natural gas, respectively and the coefficients are our best estimates
of the mean values of &#948;C
for the respective fuels, as consumed in the U.S.
Differences from other (CDIAC) emissions estimates: Marland et al. (2003) have
presented estimates of annual carbon dioxide emissions (as carbon) from fossil
fuel consumption for all countries. The values presented there for the U.S. differ
slightly from the annual sums of the monthly data presented here for 3 primary
reasons.
In order to provide comparable estimates for all countries, Marland
et al. have relied on energy data from the United Nations whereas this analysis
relies on energy data directly from the U.S. Department of Energy. United Nations
data are presumably attributable to the same U.S. Department of Energy data sets
but differences in detail occur due to differences in units, categories, accounting
conventions, and the complexity of handling large amounts of data.
Estimates
from the United Nations data are based on "apparent consumption," where "apparent
consumption" is defined as production + imports - exports - changes in stocks:
whereas the U.S. DOE data provide direct estimates of consumption. There are
systematic differences between these two data sets that are attributable to data
sampling and collection; the data sets differ by around 2%.
 emissions
during fuel combustion whereas the estimates here include a contribution from the
oxidation of petrochemical products that are used for non-fuel purposes, such as
lubricants and petroleum coke.
As a consequence of these 3 factors, the national
estimates presented here are consistently higher than those of Marland et al. and
we believe that they provide a more complete estimate of total national emissions.
The emissions estimates here do not yet account for carbon oxidized from gas flaring
or from the calcining of limestone during manufacture of cement; when combined,
these processes represent about 1 per cent of the total anthropogenic carbon emissions
from the USA (Marland et al., 2003). Neither estimate of U.S. emissions includes
CO from bunker fuels, i.e. fuels that are loaded in
the U.S. but used by planes and ships in international commerce.
The data are given strictly on a monthly basis. Because February usually has 28 days while
the adjacent months of January and March each have 31 days, about 10% less carbon
is emitted in February. For studies of the annual cycle of carbon emissions, it
may be desirable to scale the months to 30.42 days each. That is, to multiply
each month's carbon emissions by 30.42/d where d is the number of days in any
month. For leap years, the scaling factor would be exactly 30.5 instead of 30.42.
An annual cycle, peaking during the winter months and reflecting natural gas consumption,
and a semi-annual cycle of lesser amplitude, peaking in summer and winter and reflecting
coal consumption, comprise the dominant features of the annual pattern. The relatively
constant emissions until 1987, followed by an increase from 1987-1989, a decrease in
1990-1991 and record highs during the late 1990s, are also evident in the annual data of
 However, emissions have declined
somewhat since 2000.
