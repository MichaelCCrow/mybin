C measurements from air samples collected at five

and Southern Hemisphere Sites, 1962-1993
C into the
atmosphere. This major perturbation allowed scientists to study the dynamics of the global
carbon cycle by measuring and observing rates of isotopic exchange. The Radiological Dating
Laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Technology performed C measurements in
atmospheric CO from 1962 to 1993 at a network of ground stations in the Northern and
Southern hemispheres. These measurements were supplemented during 1965 with high-altitude
(9-12.6 km) air samples collected using aircraft from the Norwegian Air Force. The resulting
database, coupled with other C data sets, provides a greater understanding of the dynamic
carbon reservoir and a crude picture of anomalous sources and sinks at different geographical
latitudes. This database is outstanding for its inclusion of early C measurements, broad spatial
coverage of sampling, consistency of sampling method, and C calculation results corrected for
isotopic fractionation radioactive decay. This database replaces previous versions published
by the authors and the Radiological Dating Laboratory. 
Fourteen stations spanning latitudes from Spitsbergen (78&#176;N) to Madagascar (21&#176;S) were used
for sampling during the lifetime of the Norwegian program. Some of the stations have data for
only a brief period, while others have measurements through 1993. Sampling stations subject to
local industrial CO contamination were avoided. The sites have sufficient separation to describe
the latitudinal distribution of C in atmospheric models. The sampling procedure for all the
surface (10-2400 m asl) C measurements in this database consisted of quantitative absorption
of atmospheric COC measurements were made in
a COC level
defined by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Atmospheric C
content is finally expressed as C activity
from the NIST oxalic acid standard activity, after correction for isotopic fractionation and
radioactive decay related to age. The data are organized by sampling station, and each record of
the database contains the sampling dates; values for C) relative to the NIST
standard, fractionation C) relative to the Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) standard, and
corrected C calculation results
presented here are thus corrected for isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay, and constitute
the final product of a research effort that has spanned three decades. 
C station data show a sharp increase in tropospheric radiocarbon levels in the early 1960s
and then a decline after the majority of nuclear tests came to an end on August 5, 1963 (Test Ban
Treaty). The sharp peaks in tropospheric radiocarbon in the early 1960s are more pronounced in
the Northern Hemisphere, reflecting the location of most atomic weapons tests. The
measurements show large seasonal variations in the C level during the early 1960s mainly as a
result of springtime transport of bomb C from the stratosphere. During the 1970s, the seasonal
variations are smaller and due partly to seasonal variations in CO from fossil-fuel emissions. 
The rate of decrease of atmospheric radiocarbon provides a check on the exchange constants of
the atmosphere and ocean.
This report and all data it describes are available from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis
Center (CDIAC) without charge. The Nydal and L&#246;vseth atmospheric C database comprises 21
data files totaling 0.2 megabytes in size. The following report describes the sampling methods
and analysis. In addition, the report includes a complete discussion of CDIAC's data-processing
efforts, the contents and format of the data files, and a reprint of a Nydal and L&#246;vseth journal

C,
C (&#126;99%), small amounts of the carbon
isotopes C is radioactive with a half-life of 5730 years. In the atmosphere,
 and is usually produced by nuclear reactions between cosmic ray
neutrons and the nitrogen atoms of the air (Libby 1952). Solar (heliomagnetic), geomagnetic,
and ocean forcing all play a role in atmospheric (Stuiver and Braziunas 1993). Before
nuclear bomb testing during the 1950s and early 1960s, radiocarbon levels in the atmosphere had
been in decline. Suess (1955) demonstrated that forests grown between 1930 and 1950 had C
values 20-40 per mil below those of pre-1890 woods as a result of anthropogenic 
emissions since the Industrial Revolution. Nuclear bomb testing has since swamped the "Suess
Effect." After a series of atomic weapons tests were conducted at higher northern latitudes,
notably Novaya Zemlya in the former Soviet Union, scientists at the Radiological Dating
Laboratory in Norway seized the opportunity to conduct CO sampling to trace the distribution
and flux of bomb C with funding support from the Norwegian Research Council. In the early
1960s, several ground sampling sites were established in Norway. These Norwegian study sites
gradually expanded to a global network of 14 stations spanning latitudes from Spitsbergen (78&#176;N) to Madagascar (21&#176;S) ( sources
were avoided. Additional sites were chosen to improve spatial coverage so that the distribution
of radiocarbon could be characterized with respect to latitude. During 1965 the ground-level
measurements were supplemented with measurements made on air samples collected from the
lower stratosphere (9000-12600 m) using aircraft from the Norwegian Air Force. This data
document provides the surface C measurements made by the Radiological Dating Laboratory at
this global sampling network and the high-altitude measurements made during 1965. The C
data presented here are corrected for isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay, and constitute
the final product of a research effort that has spanned three decades. The earliest measurements
date back to 1962, and a few sites have data through 1993. Earlier versions of this database have
been presented by Nydal (1966, 1968, 1993), Nydal and L&#246;vseth (1983), and Nydal et al. (1971).C ratio of any carbon pool or reservoir caused by the
addition of fossil-fuel COC because of the
radioactive decay of C because
of isotopic fractionation long ago during photosynthesis by the plants that were the precursors of
the fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil fuels is thus virtually free
of C/C
ratio in atmospheric COC ratios in
any pool or reservoir of the carbon cycle resulting from human disturbances (Keeling 1979).
All ground-level air samples represented in this database were collected by dynamic quantitative
absorption of atmospheric CO sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. 
During the collection process, a dish of NaOH was exposed to the air for 4 to 7 days. Following
exposure, the samples were treated with hydrochloric acid to regenerate the carbon dioxide. 
After a purification procedure, the COC
content. Typically, a counter has gas volumes of 1-2 L and operates at 2 atm pressure. Until
1981 a counting time of 2 days (48 hours) was often used (Nydal and L&#246;vseth 1983), but a
counting time of 4 days was used later in order to obtain higher precision. 
High-altitude samples were collected in the Trondheim area during 1965 using aircraft from the
Norwegian Air Force. Flights originated from &#214;rlandet Airport and covered a region bounded by
62-65&#176;N and 6-10&#176;E, at altitudes of 9000-12600 m. Samples were collected using a filter with
a 1.4 kg molecular sieve that absorbs CO from the penetrating air. The filter container was
placed under the wing of the plane and opened and closed with electrically-operated shutters at
both ends. With the plane traveling at a speed of approximately 900 km/hr the filter shutters
were opened 15 minutes to allow sufficient amounts of CO to be absorbed. 
C values were calculated
as per mil excess above the normal C level defined by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST, formerly the US National Bureau of Standards). Atmospheric C content is
finally expressed as C activity from the
NIST oxalic acid standard activity, after correction for isotopic mass fractionation and
radioactive decay related to age (Stuiver and Polach 1977). C is expressed in per mil (not as a
percentage) and calculated using the following two steps:
 is 1/8267 years (T/ln2
where T is the 5730 year half-life of C) and t is the year of sampling, this small decay (2-5 per
mil) has now been applied to all the C data appearing in this database. 
For a further discussion of the sampling methods and each sampling site, please see the reprint of
Nydal and L&#246;vseth (1983) in Appendix B. For additional information on the high-altitude
sampling, see Hagemann et al. (1965), Nydal (1966), and Nydal and L&#246;vseth (1983). For
additional information on the sampling sites, radiocarbon standards, and carbon isotope
measurements, see Nydal (1966, 1968), Craig (1961), and Levin et al. (1980).
These measurements were originally made to assess potential human health risks from
radioactive fallout in the atmosphere. Fortunately it was also recognized that the radioactive
isotopes already injected into the atmosphere could be useful tracers in geophysical research. 
These C measurements document the time lag of isotopic sea-air exchange and chronicle a
long-term decline in at Northern and Southern hemisphere sites. These measurements
complement other radiocarbon data sets (Broecker and Olson 1959; Levin et al. 1985, 1995;
Manning et al. 1990; Olsson 1993) and support the pronounced twentieth-century C reduction
reported by Stuiver and Quay (1981) due to C-free carbon dioxide released by fossil-fuel
combustion. 
This data set is unique for its inclusion of measurements in the early 1960s that trace the bomb
C released by a series of nuclear tests. All measurements at the global network of sites were
taken by dynamic quantitative absorption of CO in NaOH solution. This consistency in sampling
technique over a period of three decades is valuable to researchers and modelers.
C tropospheric data show a sharp increase in tropospheric radiocarbon levels in the early
1960s and then a decline after the majority of nuclear tests came to an end on August 5, 1963
through the Test Ban Treaty. The sharp peaks in tropospheric radiocarbon in the early 1960s are
more pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere, reflecting the location of most atomic weapons
tests. The measurements show large seasonal variations in the C level in the early 1960s,
mainly as a result of springtime transport of bomb ). During the
1970s, the seasonal variations are smaller and are partly due to seasonal variations in CO from
fossil-fuel emissions. The rate of decrease of atmospheric radiocarbon provides a check on the
exchange constants of the atmosphere and ocean.
C values provided in this database are not representative of atmospheric
values. In this database the C measurements and were used to
calculate corrected ratio was not measured for every
sample. In these instances where the ratio was not measured, a mean value is given for
C and identified by a flag code. These mean values were calculated from 20-40 ground-level
measurements or 4 high-altitude measurements.

CDIAC is committed to the quality assurance (QA) of data before distribution. In order to
provide scientists and researchers with high-quality data, CDIAC reviews the data it receives for
consistent formatting, completeness, reasonableness, and accuracy. Each review involvesprogramming that is specific to the needs of each data set. These efforts are indicative of
CDIAC's mission to provide the international scientific community with high-quality, well-documented data.
CDIAC obtained the Nydal and L&#246;vseth database as an electronic-mail message from Reidar
Nydal. CDIAC staff edited the message and created the ASCII data files for each site. Working
copies of the files were created and processed in the following ways:
1. The original ASCII files were reformatted into a consistent format and combined in a single
file with data from all sites.
 and FORTRAN 77 codes were written and are available to the user for reading
any of the ASCII data files.
1. Each file was checked to ensure formatting consistency and to confirm the absence of missing
data entries.
2. Checks were performed to confirm the uniqueness of each laboratory reference code and to
ensure that sampling intervals were formatted consistently.
C data at each site
were calculated and assessed for reasonableness.
C measurements were plotted and assessed for
reasonableness.
5. Any inconsistencies or suspect measurements were reported to and addressed by the
investigators before the data set was released.

C measurements from air samples collected at five

and Southern Hemisphere Sites, 1962-1993
C into the
atmosphere. This major perturbation allowed scientists to study the dynamics of the global
carbon cycle by measuring and observing rates of isotopic exchange. The Radiological Dating
Laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Technology performed C measurements in
atmospheric CO from 1962 to 1993 at a network of ground stations in the Northern and
Southern hemispheres. These measurements were supplemented during 1965 with high-altitude
(9-12.6 km) air samples collected using aircraft from the Norwegian Air Force. The resulting
database, coupled with other C data sets, provides a greater understanding of the dynamic
carbon reservoir and a crude picture of anomalous sources and sinks at different geographical
latitudes. This database is outstanding for its inclusion of early C measurements, broad spatial
coverage of sampling, consistency of sampling method, and C calculation results corrected for
isotopic fractionation radioactive decay. This database replaces previous versions published
by the authors and the Radiological Dating Laboratory. 
Fourteen stations spanning latitudes from Spitsbergen (78&#176;N) to Madagascar (21&#176;S) were used
for sampling during the lifetime of the Norwegian program. Some of the stations have data for
only a brief period, while others have measurements through 1993. Sampling stations subject to
local industrial CO contamination were avoided. The sites have sufficient separation to describe
the latitudinal distribution of C in atmospheric models. The sampling procedure for all the
surface (10-2400 m asl) C measurements in this database consisted of quantitative absorption
of atmospheric COC measurements were made in
a COC level
defined by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Atmospheric C
content is finally expressed as C activity
from the NIST oxalic acid standard activity, after correction for isotopic fractionation and
radioactive decay related to age. The data are organized by sampling station, and each record of
the database contains the sampling dates; values for C) relative to the NIST
standard, fractionation C) relative to the Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) standard, and
corrected C calculation results
presented here are thus corrected for isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay, and constitute
the final product of a research effort that has spanned three decades. 
C station data show a sharp increase in tropospheric radiocarbon levels in the early 1960s
and then a decline after the majority of nuclear tests came to an end on August 5, 1963 (Test Ban
Treaty). The sharp peaks in tropospheric radiocarbon in the early 1960s are more pronounced in
the Northern Hemisphere, reflecting the location of most atomic weapons tests. The
measurements show large seasonal variations in the C level during the early 1960s mainly as a
result of springtime transport of bomb C from the stratosphere. During the 1970s, the seasonal
variations are smaller and due partly to seasonal variations in CO from fossil-fuel emissions. 
The rate of decrease of atmospheric radiocarbon provides a check on the exchange constants of
the atmosphere and ocean.
This report and all data it describes are available from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis
Center (CDIAC) without charge. The Nydal and L&#246;vseth atmospheric C database comprises 21
data files totaling 0.2 megabytes in size. The following report describes the sampling methods
and analysis. In addition, the report includes a complete discussion of CDIAC's data-processing
efforts, the contents and format of the data files, and a reprint of a Nydal and L&#246;vseth journal

C,
C (&#126;99%), small amounts of the carbon
isotopes C is radioactive with a half-life of 5730 years. In the atmosphere,
 and is usually produced by nuclear reactions between cosmic ray
neutrons and the nitrogen atoms of the air (Libby 1952). Solar (heliomagnetic), geomagnetic,
and ocean forcing all play a role in atmospheric (Stuiver and Braziunas 1993). Before
nuclear bomb testing during the 1950s and early 1960s, radiocarbon levels in the atmosphere had
been in decline. Suess (1955) demonstrated that forests grown between 1930 and 1950 had C
values 20-40 per mil below those of pre-1890 woods as a result of anthropogenic 
emissions since the Industrial Revolution. Nuclear bomb testing has since swamped the "Suess
Effect." After a series of atomic weapons tests were conducted at higher northern latitudes,
notably Novaya Zemlya in the former Soviet Union, scientists at the Radiological Dating
Laboratory in Norway seized the opportunity to conduct CO sampling to trace the distribution
and flux of bomb C with funding support from the Norwegian Research Council. In the early
1960s, several ground sampling sites were established in Norway. These Norwegian study sites
gradually expanded to a global network of 14 stations spanning latitudes from Spitsbergen (78&#176;N) to Madagascar (21&#176;S) ( sources
were avoided. Additional sites were chosen to improve spatial coverage so that the distribution
of radiocarbon could be characterized with respect to latitude. During 1965 the ground-level
measurements were supplemented with measurements made on air samples collected from the
lower stratosphere (9000-12600 m) using aircraft from the Norwegian Air Force. This data
document provides the surface C measurements made by the Radiological Dating Laboratory at
this global sampling network and the high-altitude measurements made during 1965. The C
data presented here are corrected for isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay, and constitute
the final product of a research effort that has spanned three decades. The earliest measurements
date back to 1962, and a few sites have data through 1993. Earlier versions of this database have
been presented by Nydal (1966, 1968, 1993), Nydal and L&#246;vseth (1983), and Nydal et al. (1971).C ratio of any carbon pool or reservoir caused by the
addition of fossil-fuel COC because of the
radioactive decay of C because
of isotopic fractionation long ago during photosynthesis by the plants that were the precursors of
the fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of fossil fuels is thus virtually free
of C/C
ratio in atmospheric COC ratios in
any pool or reservoir of the carbon cycle resulting from human disturbances (Keeling 1979).
All ground-level air samples represented in this database were collected by dynamic quantitative
absorption of atmospheric CO sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. 
During the collection process, a dish of NaOH was exposed to the air for 4 to 7 days. Following
exposure, the samples were treated with hydrochloric acid to regenerate the carbon dioxide. 
After a purification procedure, the COC
content. Typically, a counter has gas volumes of 1-2 L and operates at 2 atm pressure. Until
1981 a counting time of 2 days (48 hours) was often used (Nydal and L&#246;vseth 1983), but a
counting time of 4 days was used later in order to obtain higher precision. 
High-altitude samples were collected in the Trondheim area during 1965 using aircraft from the
Norwegian Air Force. Flights originated from &#214;rlandet Airport and covered a region bounded by
62-65&#176;N and 6-10&#176;E, at altitudes of 9000-12600 m. Samples were collected using a filter with
a 1.4 kg molecular sieve that absorbs CO from the penetrating air. The filter container was
placed under the wing of the plane and opened and closed with electrically-operated shutters at
both ends. With the plane traveling at a speed of approximately 900 km/hr the filter shutters
were opened 15 minutes to allow sufficient amounts of CO to be absorbed. 
C values were calculated
as per mil excess above the normal C level defined by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST, formerly the US National Bureau of Standards). Atmospheric C content is
finally expressed as C activity from the
NIST oxalic acid standard activity, after correction for isotopic mass fractionation and
radioactive decay related to age (Stuiver and Polach 1977). C is expressed in per mil (not as a
percentage) and calculated using the following two steps:
 is 1/8267 years (T/ln2
where T is the 5730 year half-life of C) and t is the year of sampling, this small decay (2-5 per
mil) has now been applied to all the C data appearing in this database. 
For a further discussion of the sampling methods and each sampling site, please see the reprint of
Nydal and L&#246;vseth (1983) in Appendix B. For additional information on the high-altitude
sampling, see Hagemann et al. (1965), Nydal (1966), and Nydal and L&#246;vseth (1983). For
additional information on the sampling sites, radiocarbon standards, and carbon isotope
measurements, see Nydal (1966, 1968), Craig (1961), and Levin et al. (1980).
These measurements were originally made to assess potential human health risks from
radioactive fallout in the atmosphere. Fortunately it was also recognized that the radioactive
isotopes already injected into the atmosphere could be useful tracers in geophysical research. 
These C measurements document the time lag of isotopic sea-air exchange and chronicle a
long-term decline in at Northern and Southern hemisphere sites. These measurements
complement other radiocarbon data sets (Broecker and Olson 1959; Levin et al. 1985, 1995;
Manning et al. 1990; Olsson 1993) and support the pronounced twentieth-century C reduction
reported by Stuiver and Quay (1981) due to C-free carbon dioxide released by fossil-fuel
combustion. 
This data set is unique for its inclusion of measurements in the early 1960s that trace the bomb
C released by a series of nuclear tests. All measurements at the global network of sites were
taken by dynamic quantitative absorption of CO in NaOH solution. This consistency in sampling
technique over a period of three decades is valuable to researchers and modelers.
C tropospheric data show a sharp increase in tropospheric radiocarbon levels in the early
1960s and then a decline after the majority of nuclear tests came to an end on August 5, 1963
through the Test Ban Treaty. The sharp peaks in tropospheric radiocarbon in the early 1960s are
more pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere, reflecting the location of most atomic weapons
tests. The measurements show large seasonal variations in the C level in the early 1960s,
mainly as a result of springtime transport of bomb ). During the
1970s, the seasonal variations are smaller and are partly due to seasonal variations in CO from
fossil-fuel emissions. The rate of decrease of atmospheric radiocarbon provides a check on the
exchange constants of the atmosphere and ocean.
C values provided in this database are not representative of atmospheric
values. In this database the C measurements and were used to
calculate corrected ratio was not measured for every
sample. In these instances where the ratio was not measured, a mean value is given for
C and identified by a flag code. These mean values were calculated from 20-40 ground-level
measurements or 4 high-altitude measurements.

CDIAC is committed to the quality assurance (QA) of data before distribution. In order to
provide scientists and researchers with high-quality data, CDIAC reviews the data it receives for
consistent formatting, completeness, reasonableness, and accuracy. Each review involvesprogramming that is specific to the needs of each data set. These efforts are indicative of
CDIAC's mission to provide the international scientific community with high-quality, well-documented data.
CDIAC obtained the Nydal and L&#246;vseth database as an electronic-mail message from Reidar
Nydal. CDIAC staff edited the message and created the ASCII data files for each site. Working
copies of the files were created and processed in the following ways:
1. The original ASCII files were reformatted into a consistent format and combined in a single
file with data from all sites.
 and FORTRAN 77 codes were written and are available to the user for reading
any of the ASCII data files.
1. Each file was checked to ensure formatting consistency and to confirm the absence of missing
data entries.
2. Checks were performed to confirm the uniqueness of each laboratory reference code and to
ensure that sampling intervals were formatted consistently.
C data at each site
were calculated and assessed for reasonableness.
C measurements were plotted and assessed for
reasonableness.
5. Any inconsistencies or suspect measurements were reported to and addressed by the
investigators before the data set was released.

&#214;rlandet Airport and covered the region bounded by 62-65&#176;N and 6-10&#176;E, at altitudes of 9000-12600 m. Samples were collected using a filter with a 1.4 kg molecular sieve that absorbs CO
from the penetrating air. The filter container was placed under the wing of the plane and opened
and closed with electrically-operated shutters at both ends. With the plane traveling at a speed of
approximately 900 km/hr the filter shutters were opened 15 minutes to allow sufficient amounts

      <Notes><![CDATA[ In the 1960s, thermonuclear bomb tests released significant pulses of radioactive 14C into the atmosphere. This major perturbation allowed scientists to study the dynamics of the global carbon cycle by measuring and observing rates of isotopic exchange. The Radiological Dating Laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Technology performed 14C measurements in atmospheric CO2 from 1962 to 1993 at a network of ground stations in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. These measurements were supplemented during 1965 with high-altitude (9-12.6 km) air samples collected using aircraft from the Norwegian Air Force. The resulting database, coupled with other 14C data sets, provides a greater understanding of the dynamic carbon reservoir and a crude picture of anomalous sources and sinks at different geographical latitudes. This database is outstanding for its inclusion of early 14C measurements, broad spatial coverage of sampling, consistency of sampling method, and delta 14C calculation results corrected for isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay. This database replaces previous versions published by the authors and the Radiological Dating Laboratory.
<br><br>
 Fourteen stations spanning latitudes from Spitsbergen (78 degrees N) to Madagascar (21 degrees S) were used for sampling during the lifetime of the Norwegian program. Some of the stations have data for only a brief period, while others have measurements through 1993. Sampling stations subject to local industrial CO2 contamination were avoided. The sites have sufficient separation to describe the latitudinal distribution of 14C in atmospheric models. The sampling procedure for all the surface (10-2400 m asl) 14C measurements in this database consisted of quantitative absorption of atmospheric CO2 in carbonate-free 0.5 N NaOH solution. The 14C measurements were made in a CO2 proportional counter and calculated (delta 14C) as per mil excess above the normal 14C level defined by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Atmospheric 14C content is finally expressed as delta 14C, which is the relative deviation of the measured 14C activity from the NIST oxalic acid standard activity, after correction for isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay related to age. The data are organized by sampling station, and each record of the database contains the sampling dates; values for 14C excess (14C) relative to the NIST standard, fractionation 13C (delta 13C) relative to the Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) standard, and corrected 14C (delta 14C) excess; and the standard deviation for delta 14C. The delta 14C calculation results presented here are thus corrected for isotopic fractionation and radioactive decay, and constitute the final product of a research effort that has spanned three decades.

 The delta 14C station data show a sharp increase in tropospheric radiocarbon levels in the early 1960s and then a decline after the majority of nuclear tests came to an end on August 5, 1963 (Test Ban Treaty). The sharp peaks in tropospheric radiocarbon in the early 1960s are more pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere, reflecting the location of most atomic weapons tests. The measurements show large seasonal variations in the delta 14C level during the early 1960s mainly as a result of springtime transport of bomb delta 14C from the stratosphere. During the 1970s, the seasonal variations are smaller and due partly to seasonal variations in CO2 from fossil-fuel emissions. The rate of decrease of atmospheric radiocarbon provides a check on the exchange constants of the atmosphere and ocean. ]]></Notes>
